## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (2.10.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (2.16.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimal_ecommerce_app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd minimal_ecommerce_app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Setting up IsarDB

The app uses IsarDB for local storage. When you first run the app, IsarDB will automatically initialize and create the necessary database structures.

## Project Structure

## Core Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **Fetching Products**: The app fetches product data from the FakeStore API on startup and caches it locally
2. **Local Storage**: Products added by users are stored in IsarDB and merged with API fetched products
3. **State Management**: Provider notifies the UI about changes in product list, cart, and user data

### App Features in Action

#### Product Listing
- Dynamic grid with smooth scrolling
- Products show image, title, price, and category
- Visual indicator for locally added products

#### Product Management
- Add products with name, description, image URL, price, and category
- Edit existing locally added products
- Delete products with confirmation dialog

#### Shopping Cart
- Products maintain count independently
- Animated transitions when adding/removing items
- Real-time calculation of subtotal, taxes, and final amount

#### User Profile
- Mock user data with avatar
- Purchase history section
- Settings for theme toggle and notification preferences

## Performance Optimizations

- **Image Caching**: Products images are cached for faster loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Product details are loaded on demand
- **Efficient State Updates**: Targeted widget rebuilds with Provider
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

## Usage Guide

### Product Listing
- Browse products fetched from FakeStore API on the home screen
- Tap on any product to view details
- Pull to refresh the product list

### Product Management
- Add new products using the + FloatingActionButton in the bottom-right corner
- Edit your added products by tapping the edit icon on the product card
- Delete your added products with the delete icon (only visible for locally added products)

### Shopping Cart
- Add products to cart from product details page
- View cart by tapping the cart icon in the app bar
- Increase/decrease product quantity or remove items from cart
- View real-time cart total at the bottom of the cart screen

### User Profile
